Q: You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
   You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
   Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

- int maxProfit(int* prices, int pricesSize) {
    if (pricesSize <= 1) {
        return 0;
    }
    int min_price = prices[0];
    int max_profit = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i < pricesSize; i++) {
        if (prices[i] < min_price) {
            min_price = prices[i];
        } 
        else {
            int current_profit = prices[i] - min_price;
            if (current_profit > max_profit) {
                max_profit = current_profit;
            }
        }
    }

    return max_profit;
}
